# random

This is an random number genrator which is developed from without use of any external module for random number number genration.

Here the random random numbers are genrated using LCG.A linear congruential generator (LCG) is an algorithm that yields a sequence of pseudo-randomized numbers calculated with a discontinuous piecewise linear equation.

Also you can genrate random numbers using uniform distribution..
